# Installation

1. Install a Pascal compiler (for example [Free Pascal](http://www.freepascal.org/)).
2. Compile `bomber.pas`
3. Run the created .exe file

# About the ASCII codes

For some reason, Free Pascal uses a font that has awesome icons, but is far from the standard ASCII table, so if you are planning to run the game from the .exe file, not directly from Free Pascal, use different codes for the "models".
The ones I commented out do not look terrible with Lucida Console (the default font for Windows console), but they are far from perfect, feel free to recommend me better combinations.
